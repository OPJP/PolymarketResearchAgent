# directional-maker: lab notebook

Strategy: directional crypto Up/Down maker run across three wallets
(bosona 0xc2ad03f7..., almach 0x3725d52f..., mo-money 0x32ed2e54...).
Brief: research/reverse_engineering/BRIEF.md. Workspace: this folder and
.cache/re/directional-maker/.

## Pre-registration (iteration 1, fixed for all iterations)

- Frozen dates: as_of = 1793318400, H = 1792713600 (2026-10-23 00:00 UTC).
  Nothing at or after H is loaded by any development script (every fetch is
  clamped to end < H).
- BUILD = [2026-10-09 00:00, 2026-10-16 00:00) = [1791504000, 1792108800).
  VALIDATE = [2026-10-16 00:00, 2026-10-23 00:00) = [1792108800, 1792713600).
  Earlier history (back to the first trade) is used for description only.
  Rules are chosen on VALIDATE only.
- Primary metric (higher is better): **presence AUC on VALIDATE** for BTC 5m
  Up/Down windows. Unit = (window, outcome side, 10-second bin inside the
  window's life [start-?, end)); label = the cluster (any of the 3 wallets)
  receives >= 1 maker BUY fill on that side in that bin; features use only
  information published at or before the bin start; no own-state features
  (a with-own-state variant is reported separately). A market-activity-only
  baseline AUC is reported next to it so wallet-specific signal is visible.
- Secondary metrics (reported every iteration): side accuracy (per window
  where the cluster's maker buys are >= 70% one side by shares; vs. the
  market-only baseline "buy the favourite at the time of its first fill"),
  price-within-one-tick share, per-window PnL correlation, match_test
  selection AUC / recall / lift.

## Log

### Iteration 1 (2026-10-31, started 07:24 UTC)

Data gathered (all < H):
- data-api activity of the 3 wallets, 2026-10-08..H: bosona 49,345 rows, almach 47,789, mo-money 52,405
  (`activity_<name>.parquet`). Full-history fetch (start=0) postponed (slow; cache makes a restart cheap).
- **On-chain OrderFilled logs** (V2 exchanges, topic2 = any of the 3 wallets), 2026-10-09..H, via
  `polygon-bor-rpc.publicnode.com` (drpc free plan refuses eth_getLogs ranges > ~100 blocks; publicnode takes 5,000):
  109,822 fills (97,074 maker, 12,748 taker), `chain_fills_1791504000_1792713600.parquet`. 100% join to activity on (tx, token, wallet).
  Polygon block time is ~1.5 s now (not 2 s).
- Gamma metadata of all 4,032 BTC 5m windows 2026-10-09..H (`windows_5m.parquet`), Binance 1-s klines 2026-10-08..H
  (`spot_btc_1s.parquet`), data-api taker tapes [start-900, end) of every BTC 5m window (in progress, `taker_5m*.parquet`).

Market facts (Gamma, BTC 5m): resolves on the Chainlink BTC/USD **TWAP-60s** data stream: Up iff TWAP at the end >= TWAP at
the start (priceToBeat). priceToBeat(W) == finalPrice(W-1) exactly (all windows). Gamma closedTime is 52-87 s after the end.
Tick 0.001, min order 5 shares, taker fee 7%*p(1-p), maker rebate 20%, markets listed ~24 h ahead.
Chainlink-minus-Binance basis ~ -96 USD (5-95%: -116..-63), autocorrelation 0.97 per window, 0.93 at 1 h: the Binance TWAP proxy
gets the outcome right in 98.1% of windows. (Diagnostic only; priceToBeat/finalPrice never used as features.)

BUILD description (BTC 5m, cluster maker BUY fills, 2026-10-09..16):
- 35,631 fills, $1.12M, in 1,684 of 2,016 windows. 99.3% of fill prices on the 0.01 grid (the 0.001 tick is not used).
- Fills only inside the window: none before the start; 10% by 18 s, median 139 s, 90% by 253 s; 15.6% in the first 30 s,
  only 3.7% in the last 30 s (it stops quoting near the end of the closing TWAP).
- Win rate 48.5% at avg price 0.46; USD-weighted edge +4.1% per $ bought.
- 13,650 orders (orderHash): 1 fill per order (median), 99.8% single price, 78.5% with one fill only; filled size per order
  median 69 shares, frequent 500 (572 orders), 1000, 498, 502, 333; 5 = minimum size.
- Per window: 3-6 orders (median), fills on both sides in 63% of windows, >= 70% one side in 74%; 1-3 wallets per window
  (median 2). Only 2.5% of taker transactions fill two cluster wallets at once: the wallets do not stack at the same moment.
- Counterparties: 5,310 distinct takers, top-10 = 10.5% (includes other studied wallets 0xc53375ff, 0x3048d653).
- Fill price vs Binance fair value: corr 0.85 at lag 0-2 s, 0.78 at 5 s, 0.72 at 10 s, 0.54 at 30 s (prices track fair value
  within seconds). Median price - fair_s = -0.03. Signed spot return before/after fills = 0.0 bp at 1-30 s: no adverse
  selection and no positive selection visible on Binance 1-s data.
- Fills where Binance fair_s > 0.9 have avg price 0.80 and win 0.81 (Binance fair 0.96); fair_s < 0.1: price 0.10, win 0.13.
  Conditional on a fill the market price, not the Binance fair, is calibrated.
- Dominant side (by shares) per window wins 55.9% (one-sided windows 55.8%) at a dominant-side average price 0.569; it equals
  the Binance favourite at the first fill in only 58% (59% one-sided), best at start+10 s (59-61%).
  => The cluster looks more like a fast two-sided maker earning ~4% below-fair fills than a side predictor.
