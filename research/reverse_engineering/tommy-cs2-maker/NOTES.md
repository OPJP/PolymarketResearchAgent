# tommy-cs2-maker: lab notebook

Wallet TommyLeePeeca `0x0063b23cdeb43166d6c0246c05baaf9b9bd72dd2`. CS2 in-play; taker until 15 Oct, two-sided maker from 16 Oct.
Frozen: as_of 1793318400 (2026-10-30), holdout H = 1792713600 (2026-10-23 00:00 UTC). Nothing at or after H is requested
(every fetch ends at H-1; the universe drops markets listed or starting at/after H).

## Pre-registration (iteration 1, written before any VALIDATE number was computed)

- **Primary metric: `presence_auc`** = AUC on VALIDATE of a point-in-time score predicting whether the wallet receives
  at least one fill in a (market, 30-second bin). Universe: every 30-s bin from gameStartTime to gameStartTime + 4 h
  (truncated at H) of every CS2 `moneyline` / `child_moneyline` market (match winner, map winners) whose gameStartTime
  is in the split. Features use only data stamped before the bin start (tape prints at block time, listing metadata,
  external feeds at publish time + delay); **no own-state features** in the primary (a with-own-inventory variant is
  reported separately). Higher is better; comparable across iterations.
- Secondary metrics (always reported): presence AUC within the markets it traded (conditional on market choice);
  selection AUC of its maker rows among all maker rows on the same tapes; side accuracy given a fill vs. the best
  market-only baseline; price within one tick (0.001 / 0.01); per-market PnL correlation rule vs. wallet; strict
  maker backtest return.
- **Split** (by market gameStartTime, maker regime only): BUILD = [2026-10-16 00:00, 2026-10-21 00:00),
  VALIDATE = [2026-10-21 00:00, H). The taker regime (before 16 Oct) may be used for BUILD exploration only.
  VALIDATE holds about 55% of the maker-regime fills (21-22 Oct are the busiest days), i.e. "last 30%+ of events".

## Data gathered (iteration 1)

- `code/fetch_activity.py`: full activity 2026-06-16 (first trade) .. H-1: 111,603 rows (106,016 TRADE, 3,343 REDEEM,
  2,129 MERGE, 93 TAKER_REBATE, 15 MAKER_REBATE); Gamma metadata for all 2,874 markets.
  Daily trade counts: 1-14 Oct 480-1,560/day, **15 Oct: 0**, 16 Oct 855, 17 Oct 3,879, 18 Oct 375, 19 Oct 6,063,
  20 Oct 5,236, 21 Oct 10,721, 22 Oct 9,537. Maker regime (15 Oct..H): 229 markets in 80 events, 96% CS2, 4% Dota 2;
  only match-winner (`moneyline`) and map-winner (`child_moneyline`) markets, never totals / handicaps / props.
- Market facts (Gamma): all its markets have `secondsDelay` = 1 (in-play taker delay), `clearBookOnStart` = true,
  tick 0.001, fee `sports_fees_v3` (rate 0.05, taker only, maker rebate share 0.15), rewardsMaxSpread 4.5c,
  rewardsMinSize 50, orderMinSize 5.
- `code/fetch_universe.py`: every Gamma CS2 event (series 10310) listed 25 Sep..H: 16,413 markets, ~100-200
  moneyline + child_moneyline per day. Universe metadata: league, leagueTier (2..5), pandascore id.
- `code/fetch_chain.py`: V2 OrderFilled with topic2 = wallet, blocks from 2026-10-04 to H-1 (publicnode, 4,000-block
  getLogs, logs carry blockTimestamp).
- `code/fetch_tapes.py`: full + taker-only tapes of every traded market (game start >= 16 Oct) and of every untraded
  CS2 match / map-winner market in the same period.
- bo3.gg API reachable (HLTV 403): `/api/v2/matches/finished?date=YYYY-MM-DD`, `/api/v1/matches/<slug>?with=games`,
  `/api/v1/games/<id>/rounds` (round_number, round_duration ns, end_reason, winner side, scores, equipment values;
  parsed from demos after the match, **no per-round wall clock**, only game `begin_at`).
